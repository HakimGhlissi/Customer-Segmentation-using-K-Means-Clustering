<h5> What's K-Means Clustering</h5>
The kMeans algorithm is a so-called unsupervised learning algorithm. When dealing with data, the patterns in it can't be know in advance so by using a k-means algorith, we try to 
divide it into groups with similar properties.


The "k" in kMeans is a number. The algorithm assumes that there are k centers in the data around which different data elements are scattered. 
The data  closest to these so-called hubs are categorized or grouped together.
